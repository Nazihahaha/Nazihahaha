## Hi there 👋

I’m a Computer Science graduate from BRAC University with a strong focus on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and data‑driven AI systems. My academic and research work centers on building accurate, explainable, and impactful AI, particularly in healthcare and real‑world decision‑making systems. I enjoy working at the intersection of theory, data, and application—turning complex problems into deployable solutions.

Tools I use:

Programming & AI
Python, C, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit‑learn, TensorFlow / Keras

Data & Databases
MySQL, MongoDB, SQL

Web & Deployment (for demos)
Flask, HTML, CSS, Jinja2
